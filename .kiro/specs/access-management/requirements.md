# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a comprehensive administration page for managing data access requests and current access permissions within the data contract catalog platform. The administration interface will provide administrators with tools to review pending access requests, manage current access permissions, and handle access renewals and revocations with proper notification workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view and manage pending access requests, so that I can approve or decline data access requests with proper justification tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator navigates to the administration page THEN the system SHALL display a "Pending Approvals" tab as the default view
2. WHEN viewing pending approvals THEN the system SHALL display a list showing requester name, BDAC (Business Data Access Committee) that requested, business justification, timestamp, and action buttons
3. WHEN an administrator clicks "Approve" on a pending request THEN the system SHALL grant access and move the request to current access with a one-year expiration date
4. WHEN an administrator clicks "Decline" on a pending request THEN the system SHALL open a comment dialog for decline justification
5. WHEN declining a request THEN the system SHALL provide pre-written text samples to expedite the decline process
6. WHEN a decline comment is submitted THEN the system SHALL record the decline reason and notify the requester

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage current access permissions, so that I can renew, schedule revocation, or immediately remove user access to data resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks the "Current Access" tab THEN the system SHALL display all active access permissions with expiration dates
2. WHEN viewing current access THEN the system SHALL show access details including user, resource, expiration date, and management actions
3. WHEN an administrator clicks "Renew Access" THEN the system SHALL extend the access period by one year from the current expiration date
4. WHEN an administrator clicks "Revoke Access" THEN the system SHALL initiate a 30-day notice period before access removal
5. WHEN access revocation is scheduled THEN the system SHALL create a notification to inform the user 30 days prior to access removal
6. WHEN an administrator clicks "Forcefully Remove Access Now" THEN the system SHALL immediately revoke access without the 30-day notice period

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to use predefined comment templates when declining requests, so that I can provide consistent and professional decline reasons efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening a decline comment dialog THEN the system SHALL display a text area with sample text options
2. WHEN sample texts are provided THEN the system SHALL include common decline reasons such as insufficient business justification, security concerns, and policy violations
3. WHEN an administrator selects a sample text THEN the system SHALL populate the comment field with the selected template
4. WHEN using sample text THEN the system SHALL allow administrators to modify the template text before submission
5. IF no sample text is selected THEN the system SHALL allow administrators to write custom decline comments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user whose access is being revoked, I want to receive advance notification, so that I can prepare for the access removal and request renewal if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access revocation is scheduled THEN the system SHALL create a notification 30 days before the revocation date
2. WHEN a 30-day notice is triggered THEN the system SHALL send the notification to the affected user through the platform's notification system
3. WHEN a notification is sent THEN the system SHALL include the revocation date, affected resources, and contact information for appeals
4. WHEN access is forcefully removed THEN the system SHALL immediately notify the user of the access termination
5. IF a user's access expires naturally THEN the system SHALL send renewal reminders 30 days and 7 days before expiration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to track access management actions, so that I can maintain an audit trail of all approval, decline, renewal, and revocation activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any access management action is performed THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp, administrator, and affected user
2. WHEN logging actions THEN the system SHALL record the action type (approve, decline, renew, revoke, force-remove)
3. WHEN decline or revocation actions occur THEN the system SHALL store the provided justification or reason
4. WHEN viewing access history THEN the system SHALL display a chronological log of all actions for each user's access
5. IF an audit is requested THEN the system SHALL provide exportable access management reports
