# Revocation Workflow Integration Test

## Overview
This document describes the integration test for the access revocation workflow implemented in task 11.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Schedule Revocation Workflow
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Admin page → Current Access tab
2. Find an active access permission
3. Click "Revoke" button
4. Select "Schedule Revocation (Recommended)" option
5. Click "Schedule Revocation (30 days)" button

**Expected Results:**
- RevocationNoticeDialog opens with access details
- Both revocation options are displayed
- Schedule option shows 30-day notice information
- After confirmation:
  - Access status changes to "scheduled_for_revocation"
  - Revocation date is set to 30 days from now
  - User receives notification about scheduled revocation
  - Dialog closes and selection resets

### 2. Force Revocation Workflow
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Admin page → Current Access tab
2. Find an active access permission
3. Click "Force Remove" button (or "Revoke" → Force option)
4. Select "Force Immediate Revocation" option
5. Click "Force Revoke Now" button

**Expected Results:**
- RevocationNoticeDialog opens with access details
- Force option shows warning about immediate revocation
- After confirmation:
  - Access is immediately removed from the list
  - User receives notification about immediate revocation
  - Dialog closes and selection resets

### 3. Dialog Interaction Tests
**Steps:**
1. Open revocation dialog
2. Test option selection (schedule vs force)
3. Test cancel functionality
4. Test loading states during API calls

**Expected Results:**
- Only one option can be selected at a time
- Appropriate action button appears based on selection
- Cancel button closes dialog without changes
- Loading states disable buttons and show progress text

### 4. Notification Integration
**Steps:**
1. Perform schedule revocation
2. Perform force revocation
3. Check notification sidebar

**Expected Results:**
- Schedule revocation creates "access_revocation_scheduled" notification
- Force revocation creates "access_force_revoked" notification
- Notifications contain correct user and product information
- Notifications appear in the notification sidebar

### 5. Store State Management
**Steps:**
1. Check initial store state
2. Perform revocation actions
3. Verify store state changes

**Expected Results:**
- currentAccess array is updated correctly
- revocationNotices array is populated for scheduled revocations
- Loading and error states are managed properly
- Optimistic updates work correctly
